The CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in this application are orchestrated through a seamless integration of Node.js, 
React.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, facilitating efficient data management and manipulation. Leveraging Node.js on the server-side,
the application ensures high-performance handling of CRUD operations, enabling the creation, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data.
React.js, with its declarative and component-based architecture, drives the frontend, providing a dynamic and intuitive user interface.
Express.js serves as the middleware, facilitating communication between the frontend and backend, while MongoDB, a NoSQL database,
offers scalability and flexibility in data storage. Through the implementation of routing, the application seamlessly navigates between
different pages, including create and edit pages, allowing users to interact with the data in an intuitive and efficient manner. 
Overall, this integrated stack empowers developers to build robust web applications with comprehensive CRUD functionalities, 
ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience.
